You consent to the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy, which may change from time to time as our services evolve.

You agree and represent that all registration information provided by you is accurate and up-to-date. If any of your registration information changes, you must update it by using the appropriate update mechanism on the Website.  If you are unsure how to update your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@skeddly.com.

This Privacy Policy describes: (i) our collection of personal information; (ii) how that personal information may be used; and (iii) when and to whom that personal information may be disclosed.

Collection of Personal Information

We may collect your personal information, including but not limited to your:

* Name;

* Other types of raw data relating to how you interact with the Site including, for example, your browser information and session duration;
* Banking and/or credit card information; and
* Any other information requested from you upon signing up to become a subscriber to our Service.

With respect to any personal information supplied to us, we keep personal information only for as long as it is required for the purposes for which it was collected and compliance with laws and regulations.  Consequently, there is no single retention period applicable to all instances of personal information collected by us.

The Use of Your Personal Information

The collection of your personal information is used to:

* Provide customer support;

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. 

We use third party payment processors (“Payment Processors”) including for example Stripe, PayPal and others. We do not keep or have access to the information you provide to the Payment Processors including, for example, your credit card number.  You agree that your legal relationship with the Payment Processor is separate and that the Payment Processor may impose their own terms and have their own privacy policy in place for the collection and use of your information. 

The Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Access to It

We may share your personal information with our employees who need to use that information in connection with one or more of the purposes for which that personal information was collected.

We may operate the Website and Service in conjunction with independent contractors. Our independent contractors may have access to your personal information. We may use a variety of service providers, partners or affiliates in locations both inside and outside of Canada, which may make your personal information the subject of foreign laws and foreign legal proceedings.

We may also access and/or disclose your personal information if required or permitted to do so by law (for example, in order to comply with a legal process including but not limited to one imposed by a warrant, subpoena, court order or like instrument served on us).

We may also disclose your personal information to our successors (if our business, the Website or the Service is acquired by another legal entity), or any assignee of our assets relating to the Website and Service.

WHILE WE TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE LOSS OR THEFT OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED AS A RESULT THEREOF.

Retention of Your Personal Information 

When any personal information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected, we destroy the personal information in a manner that takes into account its sensitivity.

Use of Cookies

Our Website and Service may place a temporary or permanent “cookie” in the browser files of your computer.  The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information.  However, the cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Website to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.  By changing the settings in your web browser you can prevent cookies from being used, but doing so may interrupt the proper use of the Website and Service.

Inquiries

If you believe that we have not adhered to this Privacy Policy or would like to request an amendment to your personal information being held by us, please contact our Privacy Officer by e-mail sent to privacy@skeddly.com.
