# PRIVACY POLICY

Last modified: May 7, 2018

You consent to the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy, which may change from time to time, as our website https://www.skeddly.com (the "Website") and related online AWS Automation Service (the "Service") evolves.

You agree, represent and warrant that all account registration information provided by you is accurate and up-to-date. If any of your registration information changes, you must update it by using the appropriate update mechanism on the Website or Service.  If you are unsure how to update your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@skeddly.com.

This privacy policy describes: (i) our collection of personal information; (ii) how that personal information may be used; and (iii) when and to whom that personal information may be disclosed.

## Collection of Personal Information

We may collect your personal information, including but not limited to your:

* Name;
* Contact information;
* IP address and location data;
* Website statistics and analytics data regarding your use of the Website and Service;
* Other types of raw data relating to how you interact with the Website and Service including, for example, your browser information and session duration;
* Banking and/or credit card information;
* Any other information requested from you upon signing up to become a subscriber or account holder on our Service; and 
* While we do not request it, there may be other instances where you elect to upload information to our Service that includes your, or a third party’s personal information. 

## Collection of Personal Information by Affiliate Software Provider

To learn more about our affiliate program and affiliate software provider, visit https://www.skeddly.com/partners/referral-program. 

## Data Logs

Part of our Service includes running processes on your data in your AWS account. When such processes are run, data logs are created by our software which record the names of the files, resources, objects, or items our Service processed. The data logs are available in your account on the Service. 

To the extent the names of your resources include any personal information, such personal information may be stored and replicated in the logs our Service creates. While we have access to the file logs to provide customer and technical support, billing and audit trails, aside from running the processes requested on your data, we do not access any underlying resources stored in your AWS account.  

## PROVIDING US WITH THIRD-PARTY PERSONAL INFORMATION

TO THE EXTENT YOU PROVIDE US OR OUR SERVICE WITH, OR ACCESS TO, OR UPLOAD DATA TO  THE SERVICE THAT INCLUDES THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF ANOTHER PERSON, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THEIR AUTHORIZATION AND INFORMED CONSENT TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION, AND TO USE THAT INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OUR TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE ORDINARY FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SERVICE, AS UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU AGREE THAT INFORMED CONSENT INCLUDES ADVISING SUCH THIRD PARTIES THAT, WHERE APPLICABLE, THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH ELEVEN41 SOFTWARE INC.

With respect to any personal information supplied to us, we keep personal information only for as long as it is required for the purposes for which it was collected and compliance with laws and regulations.  As a result, there is no single retention period applicable to all instances of personal information collected by us. Upon your request, we will redact or where appropriate, delete, any third party personal information stored in the data logs. 

If you terminate your account with us and there are no balances on your account owing to us, we may also delete your personal information, account, data logs and any other information stored by us concerning your account.

The collection of your personal information is used to:

* Pursue available legal remedies to us;
* Meet legal requirements;

We use third party payment processors ("Payment Processors") including for example Stripe, PayPal and others. We do not keep or have access to all the information you provide to the Payment Processors including, for example, your full credit card number.  However, we will have the ability to bill your payment method and access to certain personal information you provide the Payment Processors, such as the name on your credit card, the address associated with the card and the credit card expiration date. You agree that even though the Payment Processor’s electronic forms may be hosted on our Website or Service, your legal relationship with the Payment Processor is separate and that the Payment Processor may impose their own terms and have their own privacy policy in place for the collection and use of your information.
